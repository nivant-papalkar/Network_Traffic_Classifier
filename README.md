# Network Traffic Classification System | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas

Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to classify network traffic using structured connection-level features.

Performed data preprocessing with ColumnTransformer, applying One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables and numerical feature passthrough.

Trained and evaluated a Random Forest Classifier to learn complex traffic patterns from labeled network flow data.

Designed a fully automated prediction pipeline to generate submission-ready outputs (submissions.csv) from unseen test data.

Implemented modular and reproducible workflow using Scikit-learn Pipelines to prevent data leakage and streamline experimentation.

Prepared the system for scalability and future upgrades such as hyperparameter tuning and advanced ensemble models.
